Hand and face gestures are used to convey meaning in ASL. Many deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals in North America use it as their primary language.The precise origins of ASL are unknown, however some believe it evolved more than 200 years ago from the mixing of local sign languages and French Sign Language (LSF). Today's ASL has certain parts of LSF as well as the original local sign languages; over time, these have merged and developed into a rich, sophisticated, and mature language. Modern ASL and modern LSF are different languages. While they still include some identical indicators, they can no longer be understood by each other's users.\n","<br>ASL is a fully unique and distinct language from English. It has all of the basic properties of language, including its own rules for pronunciation, word creation, and word order. While every language contains means of indicating distinct purposes, such as asking a question rather than making a statement, the manner in which this is done varies throughout languages.\n","<br>Specific ways of expressing concepts in ASL, as in other languages, vary as much as ASL users themselves. ASL includes regional accents and dialects, much as some English words are spoken differently in different regions of the country; similarly, ASL has regional variations in the rhythm of signing, pronunciation, slang, and signs employed. As with spoken languages, other societal variables such as age and gender can influence ASL usage and add to its diversity.\n","ASL includes fingerspelling, which is used to sign out English words. Each letter in the fingerspelled alphabet corresponds to a different handshape. Fingerspelling is frequently employed to signify proper names or the English term for something.\n","\n",">The dataset contains 26 alphabets classes and 3 special character classes viz.
